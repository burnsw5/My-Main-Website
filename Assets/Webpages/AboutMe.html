          <p>Hello, My name is Wesley Burns and I am from Virginia.
            I was born in January of 1999, in the state of Washington. Growing up was really challenging, 
            I did a fair amount of moving. My parents had split when I was very young, and I was back and forth between the two of them. 
            I am the oldest brother out of all my siblings. 
            Around the time I started middle school I struggled alot with social anxiety and being around people. So school for me was awful, all the time.
            As I got older I chose not to persue college, and instead I dropped out high school. 
            Later I joined the Army, and that ended up not working out. When I came back I was in and out of low paying jobs. 
            Finally I started working with Amazon, and that lasted for two solid years, before leaving. I wasnt respected at that company, and I wanted to persue a different journey.  
            In August of 2018 my wife Maranda and I got married. Two years later on July 25th, 2020 we had our daughter Valarie. 
             I am currently pursuing Web Development at U of R. I would like to do this as a fulltime career.</p>
