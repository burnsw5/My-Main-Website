# My-Main-Website
This website is all about myself and any work I do now, and in the future. You can find an about me page, and that talks a little about my life. You can find a portfolio page as well. That will host clickable images to all the work I have done. In the top right of all pages, you can click on my Github, my Linkedin and my Instagram.
